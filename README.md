# CV/Resume to PDF

Every once in a while, we want to update our Resume/CV but it becomes real difficult with so many paid third-party tools or consultancy services.

This repo was created to make my own professional Resume and help others like me struggling to create a creative, out-of-the-box and innovative Resume.

## Guidelines

When creating a tailored resume you should following these guidelines:

* Page size: US Letter (8.5 x 11 inches) => (816 x 1056 px).

* Recommended Fonts: Calibri (modern), Arial (a happy medium), Times New Roman (traditional).

* Font size for your title: 24 pt.

* Font size for section headers: 14 pt.

* Font size for section content: 10.5 - 12 px

* Page margin width for CVs: 1/2 to 1 in (1 in = 2.5 cm or 96 px)

* Name of your resume file: FIRST-NAME—LAST-NAME—RESUME—EMPLOYER-NAME—JOB-TITLE.pdf

For more guidelines check [guidelines](ApplicantTrackingSystem%20guidelines.pdf).

## How to

The page was done using `Bootstrap 5` and `font-awesome 5.15.x`, if you don't have any experience working with those I'd recommend you to read about them first.

You can use any editor of your choice, I used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to launch a local development server and preview my changes.

To view the page directly in the browser:

* Press `Ctrl + P` or `Print` in your browser settings.
* If your using Chrome or Edge, select `Save As PDF`, this option uses A4 format (roughly 1140px width) and won't mess with the CSS.
* Click on `More setting` at the Print settings panel.
* Select `None` or `Minimum` margins and check `Background graphics`.
